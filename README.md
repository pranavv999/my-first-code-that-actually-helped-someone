# my-first-code-that-actually-helped-someone
my uncle recieved a txt file  and there was several account entries from that he had to extract all the entries above 1000 Rs  and being old he is not good and fast with computer stuff  so he started writing each entry on paper. so i wrote a little python program and that extracted all the entries above 1000Rs. Yes I know tits not a big  or a unique program. but i am learning python from last 3 months and i came from non IT background and when i saw my uncle  copying everything on paper i said hey stop  i can help you out and i wrote it
